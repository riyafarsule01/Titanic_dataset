# TASK 5 :  EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA) ON THE TITANIC DATASET 

A data analysis project to uncover the factors that influenced passenger survival during the sinking of the Titanic. This EDA uses Python with Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to explore the dataset, identify key trends, and visualize findings.



### üìñ Key Questions This analysis seeks to answer several core questions:

What was the overall survival rate?

How did survival rates differ based on gender and socio-economic class?

What was the demographic profile (e.g., age) of the passengers?

Is there a correlation between the fare a passenger paid and their chance of survival?



### üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used The analysis was performed using the following Python libraries:

Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.

Seaborn: For making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.




### üñºÔ∏è Key Visualizations Visuals were key to identifying the story within the data.

Survival Rate by Passenger Class This chart clearly shows the survival disparity between the classes.

Survival Rate by Sex The most dramatic finding is the difference in survival rates between men and women.

Correlation Heatmap This heatmap numerically confirms the relationships between variables like Pclass, Fare, and Survived.
